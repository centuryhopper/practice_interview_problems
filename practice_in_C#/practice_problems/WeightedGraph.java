// WeightedGraph.java
// ==================
// This file includes my implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. I'll be
// honest: I have not vetted this carefully. Let me know if you find bugs.
//
// The constructor is a variation on the constructor we saw from Graph.java
// last week, which only worked with unweighted graphs.
