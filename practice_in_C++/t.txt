There's certainly a lot going on here. Kiaya wants to sing because she's practiced a lot for the songs and wants to be included, but it is clear that she doesn't feel included and whether she will or not is up in the air until wednesday. It's good that you stood up for her with your growth mindset of wanting to include everyone. Rick said you crossed the lines when you stood up for kiaya and mentioned there's some things behind the scenes said to kiaya that you aren't aware of, so that's something to consider (but I do admire your good intentions and low-key I might have done the same thing as I don't tolerate excluding teammates in any way). Ultimately, there's definitely some miscommunication going on and it's dividing you guys a little bit. I think everyone on the team should get a chance to sing and be included :) I don't know how many are on the team, but assuming it's small and sounds like it's four when it comes to singing only, so if Kiaya didn't sing for three weeks then that's pretty unusual. Are you and Kiaya new to the team? If not, then how does your teammate not know you two are comfortable with the songs?
